The original data for this project was provided by the Nomura Research Institute, Ltd. Because of their ownership of the data, it has not been uploaded to this repository.

Note: Since this is a very old project (2019) since before I was accostumed to using git version control and GitHub repositories, the code is presented AS IS, as I found it in my old folders. I also worked across different computers, so there might be some disconnect in the process and logs.
